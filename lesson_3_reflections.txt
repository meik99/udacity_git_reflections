When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When the project is large and i want to have it saved in a cloud
    
    If i want to share it with the community
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Git could overwritte changes i haven't comitted yet, or i am
    working on a feature which shouldn't be published yet.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    forks:
        A GitHub Feature that clones a repo into a repo of yours and links it to 
        the original creator
    clone:
        A clone of a repository with all its files and commits
    branches:
        Something that sperates new experimental code from the production
